    <h1>Supporting Canada’s communities to reach net zero by 2050</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      The mission of <strong>Sustainable Community Solutions Canada (SCS Canada)</strong> is to support communities in Canada
      to achieve net-zero goals by 2050 — with equity at the center.
    </p>

      <h2>Make net zero work for everyone — especially those left out.</h2>
      <p>
        We help North America’s communities cut emissions in buildings, transport, and waste while lowering bills
        and closing the energy burden gap (<em>energy equity</em>, not just energy tech).
        DEI isn’t a side quest when it comes to net zero — for us, it’s how we prioritize projects and measure success.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>Turn climate plans into habits people actually adopt.</h2>
      <p>
        We co-create practical playbooks, run educational courses and public-awareness campaigns, and “teach the teachers”
        so residents, small businesses, and community members know what to do next week — not just by 2050.
        We create actionable roadmaps in collaboration with stakeholders and interest holders.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>Build resilience you can feel when the lights flicker.</h2>
      <p>
        We back, research, and deliver minor, major, and deep retrofits, local renewables, and community resiliency programs.
        We focus on delivering emissions reduction, cost minimization, and closing the inequity gap.
